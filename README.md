# The-Integrated-FOrward-Forward
This is my implementation for the Integrated Forward-Forward Algorithm, or IntFFA.
With tensorflow 2.9, you can easily run these code to justify the results in my paper.
Backpropagation, Forward-Forward, IntegratedForwardForward are all implemented in the coresponding .py files.
To change the model size, find the line where we define the model in the main function and change the dimentions at your preference.
If you want to use Attention mechanism or convolution mechanism in these algorithms, change the two handcrafted classes at your preference.
